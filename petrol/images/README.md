# Logo Directory

Place your `logo.png` file here for the splash screen.

## Requirements

- **Filename:** Must be named `logo.png`
- **Format:** PNG format (supports transparency)
- **Recommended size:** 400x400 pixels or larger
- **Aspect ratio:** Square or rectangular

## Behavior

- If `logo.png` exists: It will be displayed centered on a white background
- If `logo.png` is missing: A text placeholder "PETROL PUMP" will be shown instead
- The splash screen displays for 3 seconds before transitioning to the main pump display

## Creating a Sample Logo

You can create a simple sample logo by running:
```bash
./create-sample-logo.sh
```

This requires ImageMagick to be installed.
